# peanut-butter-quiz-backend

A **really** quickly written quiz site (because Google Forms just isn't good enough ðŸ˜Š) for my studies on Peanut Butter. It uses the FastAPI library in python for the API endpoints (and also serving the site) and obviously HTML/JS for the frontend form/graphing results. Because the core of this was made in like 5ish hours (and then another 6 hours to make it look nice) it really, really badly written (but it works and isn't that what matters?).
